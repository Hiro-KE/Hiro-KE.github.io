### **Programming**
I am a software engineer experienced in Unreal Engine development (Blueprints/C++) and Point Cloud Library while being passionate for 3D applications and tools (Video Games and visualizations).
My experiences are mainly focused on :
- Combat systems (Creating a full gameplay framework, replicated with a scalable optimization for MMORPG purposes)
- Optimization (Networking, Memory, CPU usage). (Able to solve bottlenecks and write down reports about issues, solutions and better approaches for future implementations) 
- Core Engine Programming (Editing Unreal Engine when needed in order to avoid workarounds or to improve the workflow)
- Technical Art (Custom Shadings, Animation layering systems)
- Third party libraries and interaction (Able to implement modules that interact with external programs or libraries such as GDI+, Arduino, Databases, etc.)

 

### **Art**

I have a huge insight over every pipeline in the 3D art field.
This includes a variety of tasks such as modeling, texturing, rigging, animating, materials workflow.
I am, eventually, able to write and deliver well elaborated technical thoughts and tasks for each team member in these fields for multiple purposes (Games, CGI or Visualizations.. etc).
